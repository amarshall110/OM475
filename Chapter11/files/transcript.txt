I can remember the first time I watched this move with great clarity. My family and I went to the nearest video rental store in the early 2000s, and my mom let me pick out a movie to watch for myself. I browsed the aisles and picked out what looked like a colorful and exciting cover for the movie titled, "Spirited Away." I had up until this point never watched any Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli films, so I did not know what to expect. As a brief synopsis, the main character, a 10 year old girl named Chihiro, was moving with her parents to a small town in the Japan countryside. On their travels, the family stumbles upon an abandoned amusement park and town, which unbeknownst to them, is in the spirit world. After her parents are turned into pigs and her name is stolen by an evil witch, Chihiro must work to try to free her parents. She meets a boy named Haku, who helps her save her parents and return to her world. 
Even as a child, I was immediately blown away by the detailed scenery and music so inherent in all of Miyazaki's films. The story of the young herione who is left abandoned and alone in a world of terrifying spirits and monsters but refuses to give up on saving herself and her parents is inspiring. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves animated films.
