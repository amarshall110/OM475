          <h3 class="h3-header">High School</h3>
          <p>I attended Reed-Custer High School in Braidwood, Illinois. During my years in High School, I was actively involved in Speech Team, Math Team, Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering (WYSE), Scholastic Bowl, and soccer. I was also a member of our Concert Band playing bassoon, Jazz Band playing trombone, and musical pit crew playing both instruments depending on the production. </p>

          <h3 class="h3-header">Time Before NIU</h3>
          <p>After graduating high school in 2010, I immediately entered the University of Illinos at Urbana Champaign, intending to pursue a degree in History. On campus, I was involved in a few university groups, including LAS Leaders, Pancakes for Poverty, and Astrology Club. I soon realized that History was not my passion, and I began taking classes in Physics, Computer Science, and other sciences. No longer knowing what I wanted to pursue as a career, I left the university and began working full time while I worked out my goals. I eventually decided on re-entering university for a degree Business, but unfortunately my Liberal Arts and Sciences and Engineering background did not satisfy many of the early business requirements such as Accounting or Business Law. I took nearby courses at the local Joliet Community College to get some of these requirements out of the way before transferring to NIU.</p>
