                    In July 2018, I got the opportunity to participate in an internal event within the Product Support (PS) Department at SAP. Individuals were separated into teams with members spanning from Vancouver, Canada to Lake Mary, Florida. The goal of the event was to create a basic business plan and prototype for an innovative idea within PS. My team was assigned an idea for a new dashboard and reporting system for the managers within the organization. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During this two day event, the team held 8-10 hours of meetings involving design thinking, which resulted in brainstormed ideas for the user story and direction for the overall prototype. Group members were also responsible for conducting interviews and performing an environment analysis to prepare the final presentation for the judges.

                   <p>
                      Our team was selected the North America West winners by a panel of executive and management judges.

                <div>
                    <p>
                      After winning the InnoJam, our team qualified to compete in the Global DemoJam, consiting of teams from across the globe. In the DemoJam, the teams had four months to create a full business case for the idea and a functioning demo to present to a second panel of judges from the global organization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As I did not have the relevant UI5 experience, I volunteered to take point on creating the business case for our team. This involved performing interviews, collecting data, sending out surveys, gauging feedback, and a high-level of research on the internal and external environment in order to properly format the case. Our team submitted our presentation materials to the first panel of judges and got the go decision to present at the final competition.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      After presenting to the final panel of judges, our team was ranked in the top 8 finalists, but we did not win.
