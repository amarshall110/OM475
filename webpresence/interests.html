        <p class="coursep">Drawing and Painting</p>
        <p>Throughout my life, I have loved to draw and paint in my free time. I started off with simple, traditional mediums such as acryllic and oil paint on canvas or various pencils on drawing paper, but I have branched out to different mediums in the last few years. I learned how to create artwork in Photoshop last year using a drawing tablet, and I have experimented with polymer clay to create miniature scultpures. I usually create artwork related to my favorite movies, video games, anime, books, or television shows, and I occassionally do an artwork as a commission for family and friends.</p>

        <div>
         <p class="coursep">Video Games</p>
        <p> I was introduced to video games at a very young age by my older brother with the original Sega Genesis system. This hobby has developed across years, genres, and consoles, from 8-bit graphics to interactive Virtual Reality. While I have played on many different consoles over the years, my current focus has been on the PlayStation 4. Most recently, I have been playing primarily Rainbow Six: Siege, a competitive tactics-based shooter game, and Star Wars Battlefront II after content-adding updates.</p>
         </div>
         <div>
          <p class="coursep">Reading</p>
        <p>Between traditional books, ebooks, and audiobooks, I rarely go a week without spending at least a few hours consuming a book. I once spent over three hundred hours in a single month listening to audiobooks, over ten hours a day. My favorite genre is generally science fiction/fantasy, but I will occassionally branch into historical non-fiction. In no particular order, my favorite book series are: Wheel of Time, Stormlight Archive, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, A Song of Ice and Fire, and the Kingkiller Chronicle. </p>
