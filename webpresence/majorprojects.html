                    <p> In this course, students were assigned random group members for the semester to form a project management team. These teams were tasked with creating a projet charter and following the project planning and execution process from start to finish. This included creating a project proposal/MOV, analyzing the environment and alternatives, performing a risk assessment, creating a work breakdown structure, and analyzing the project's success or failure based on the set objectives.</p>
                    <p>For my team, I was designated the Project Manager by my group members, so I was responsible for a majority of the planning and operations for the project. We analyzed a few alternative projects but ultimately decided to hold a fundraiser for the local Homeless Shelter: Hope Haven.</p>

                    <p>In this course, students chose small teams of three to four members to perform an analysis and visualization of a dataset of the team's choosing. The primary visualization occurred in Tableau, a visualiation software used in many businesses. Students were required to analyze the relationships between variables and provide actionable insights based on the visualization in a term paper.</p>
                    <p>
                      My group selected a dataset from Kaggle.com about a Speed Dating Experiment. We performed basic analysis of some of the key variables and relationships in SAP Predictive Analytics and Excel, then created various visualiations to explore this dataset further. We were able to come to various conclusions about the relationship between personality traits, attractiveness, wealth, and more and the overall likeability and dateability of an individual.
