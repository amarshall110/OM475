                    <p> In this course, students were assigned random group members for the semester to form a project management team. These teams were tasked with creating a projet charter and following the project planning and execution process from start to finish. This included creating a project proposal/MOV, analyzing the environment and alternatives, performing a risk assessment, creating a work breakdown structure, and analyzing the project's success or failure based on the set objectives.</p>
                    <p>For my team, I was designated the Project Manager by my group members, so I was responsible for a majority of the planning and operations for the project. We analyzed a few alternative projects but ultimately decided to hold a fundraiser for the local Homeless Shelter: Hope Haven.</p>
                    <p>Please see the additional links below for a some of the  documentation that was created for this project.</p>

                    <p>In this course, students were assigned to groups at the beginning of the semester and tasked with performing an in-depth analysis of how a specific process and quality improvement method was implemented at any organization. This analysis was intended to be completed through various scholarly research, articles, and an interview with a current or former employee of the organization.</p>
                    <p>For this semester-long project, my team chose to focus on how various benchmarking processes were employed by the Exelon Corporation. Our group spent weeks refining our interview questions and researching the major methodologies for benchmarking both generically and in the industry. The culmination of the project can be seen in the link below. This paper was awarded the top paper in the class by the professor.</p>

                    <p>For this course, students were put into pairs for a semester-long project and guided to choose a business for which to create a database. This project was broken down into many parts, from assessing the current business needs, creating an E-R diagram, structuring the databse in SQL, inserting data, and running queries to provide useful insights for the organization. </p>
                    <p>Unexpectedly, the database that we initial conceived and designed was passed off to our teammates, which required each student to work with the business partner to understand the needs of another business/organization in order to design the database. My initial busiess proposal was a transaction based system for a service organization, but I ended up designing the full database for my partner's event planning company. Some of the key project steps can be found in the links below.</p>

                    <p>In this course, students were tasked with selecting a business and improving an existing system-based process using the techniques covered in this course. This included constructing Level 0 and Level 1 Data Flow Diagram, User Stories, UX/UI mockups, and more for the specific system or process chosen for improvement.  </p>
                    <p>My team chose to improve an incident processing system used by a large software corporation. We believed the existing system as detailed by the internal and external users was outdated and lacked key features necessary for efficient work. Below are links for a few portions of this project.</p>

                    <p>In this course, students chose small teams of three to four members to perform an analysis and visualization of a dataset of the team's choosing. The primary visualization occurred in Tableau, a visualiation software used in many businesses. Students were required to analyze the relationships between variables and provide actionable insights based on the visualization in a term paper.</p>
                    <p>
                      My group selected a dataset from Kaggle.com about a Speed Dating Experiment. We performed basic analysis of some of the key variables and relationships in SAP Predictive Analytics and Excel, then created various visualiations to explore this dataset further. We were able to come to various conclusions about the relationship between personality traits, attractiveness, wealth, and more and the overall likeability and dateability of an individual.
